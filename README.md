# Stock-Price-Prediction-with-SAS
Time series models can be applied to a myriad of forecasting challenges. In this project, we explored the use of such models for forecasting stocks and using the forecasts to predict the performance of stock sectors. Specifically, we used the ARIMA(X), UCM and ESM models to predict the performance of fifteen stocks in the Oil and Gas, Public Utilities and Transportation sectors, and using the predicted stocks performance we predicted an overall forecast for the three sectors.
